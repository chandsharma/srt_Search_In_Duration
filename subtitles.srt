1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
Hay everybody she told formation Boss did you

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,900
know that English is a very widely spoken

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,900
language in India in fact

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,900
whenever we do the street interviews

5
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,900
yours always wonder that

6
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,700
why people are answering in

7
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,300
English and modern jewellery.

8
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,600
What do Indians think about this

9
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,800
actually aware of how their

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,800
actions sounds that had the

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,300
streets of Mumbai to find out

12
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,800
if you have to guess what

13
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,100
percentage of Indian population

14
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,100
can speak fluent English

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,900
Any

16
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,800
colleges of school lowest price in Hindi

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,800
at all with everything needed to English is

18
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,600
also I think that 70 to

19
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,700
80% might know English English is

20
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,800
far more important than Hindi write

21
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,900
for Indians

22
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,000
having

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,900
4245 person around people speak

24
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,800
fluent English I guess around

25
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,700
75% of Indian people can

26
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,400
speak English fluently.

27
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,100
Most

28
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,800
of them are from South India because they are like

29
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,800
they are much more educated

30
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,400
than the people living in North India

31
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,600
that my opinion and

32
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,800
my I am I film south ine. So

33
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,400
Indian English

34
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,900
does have a particular accent

35
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,900
do you agree with that?

36
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,800
I think it

37
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,100
does proper English

38
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,800
So it's not action is

39
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,300
proper English

40
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,900
any

41
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,900
problem with the people as such because

42
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,200
that is the way we talked

43
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,900
does normal write your experience

44
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,800
as an Indian

45
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,900
person. Who were you aware that foreigners

46
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,800
often makes fun of the Indian

47
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,900
English accent.

48
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,800
It is actually

49
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,200
or when I

50
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,900
have not personally and counted the

51
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,300
situation, but my

52
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,900
cousins who live in the US is

53
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,900
pleased that you need US

54
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,900
accent of English but still get

55
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,200
jaj

56
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,400
Indian and

57
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,800
why it's

58
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,100
basically racism and

59
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,700
its sense to me physically,

60
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,800
but I

61
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,800
went to night status

62
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,600
of this program English one

63
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,700
of their English search doesn't make any difference.

64
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,700
I think it

65
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,600
is better than the US because

66
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,400
they are I think they are like

67
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,700
Not that good looks exactly like

68
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,800
sorry. Sorry not

69
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,400
often. It looks like the spitting

70
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,600
and I think accent is better.

71
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,700
No, no,

72
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,400
I

73
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:24,900
think

74
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,300
They need to learn English from as

75
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,900
it is like when we are them we

76
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,400
find it funny

77
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:37,400
that

78
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,900
people understand I want to

79
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,300
say that only

80
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,900
characters like up from

81
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,200
the Simpsons have

82
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,800
perpetuated stereotype in western culture

83
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,900
that Indian sound funny when

84
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,800
they speak English how does that

85
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,500
make you feel I

86
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,800
think it's if

87
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,700
you watch if I think it's funny

88
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,900
at times, but then it really

89
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,900
annoys you will kill, you know, you

90
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,900
stereotyping as a little too much

91
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,500
you taking too far.

92
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,700
We don't really sound like

93
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,500
that over time by

94
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,800
ok you

95
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,600
guys to the foreigner

96
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,900
funny to anybody in

97
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,700
India because that is the way we talked

98
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,800
to people understand that

99
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,700
the main thing sometimes I feel

100
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,000
offended but the

101
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,400
exaggerated more I think

102
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,900
We don't speak like that

103
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,900
firstly, but I feel

104
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,000
offended sometime I

105
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,400
do

106
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,500
not like that stop doing dark

107
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,700
them to you which English accent

108
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,700
sounds funny or weird.

109
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,600
The way Russian speak

110
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,500
Amitabh people those who

111
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,600
have their languages Russian or

112
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,700
French

113
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,000
English

114
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,900
speaking people seriously. My brother

115
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,800
has been Australia and his action

116
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,100
is literally funny

117
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,800
for me. Australian accent

118
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,900
is I really don't understand any

119
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,700
of it literally enough

120
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,800
doesn't understand

121
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,800
the

122
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,600
wrong medical use. I

123
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,500
find Chinese English quite funny,

124
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,800
which is the they don't use

125
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,200
the proper in a grammatical

126
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,400
things.

127
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,800
So their

128
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,300
languages

129
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:31,800
pronounce

130
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,700
it very well that

131
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,400
everybody

132
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,800
speak English as opposed to the native

133
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,800
Indian languages in India IAS

134
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,900
beating in English is

135
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,600
a friend or maybe

136
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,800
it is like to show

137
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,700
off or something.

138
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,900
If you know English you have lots of

139
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,800
friends and I

140
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,800
will your pool

141
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,100
because

142
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,700
they want the kids to speak English so

143
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,800
that when the Goodwill School the don't

144
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,900
feel ashamed that every child

145
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,800
is taught from an early

146
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,300
young age

147
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:12,700
at

148
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,900
my home. I should speak now native language

149
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,900
and he pays good fees for my school

150
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,900
school the responsibility

151
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,700
to teach me English so how does

152
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,500
everyone was but that's our

153
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,000
water.

154
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,700
Most of the people

155
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,600
people feel that

156
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,700
when there are educated in

157
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,600
English they will have thyroid

158
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,700
job opportunities and then

159
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,400
their dream about going to

160
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,200
other countries for job

161
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,800
that the basic reason for them learn English

162
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,900
otherwise they would not even be interested in knowing the

163
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,400
language to speak fluent English

164
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,200

that

167
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,900
you

168
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,200
have

169
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,500
them

170
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,300

talking in English and especially when you talking dinner

177
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,000
fluently

178
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,400

00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,900
dominant language in Indian society.

182
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,600
Are you have a concern that

183
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,700
traditional Indian languages might

184
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,700
disappear is

185
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,700

forget our own native language if this continues

193
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,900
for that day is

194
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,100
not far that this

195
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,500
this will be our national

196
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,600
not quite

197
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,600
concerned about it because we

198
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,900
often have many organisations and

199
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,500
cultural committee is to focus on

200
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,800
other languages. So I don't think it is

201
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,900
dying out because there are many people who

202
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,600
supported and I want our

203
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,300
traditional languages to last forever.

204
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,900
I am I am bit concerned because

205
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,400
as I said before

206
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,800
it is life when a child is

207
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,400
born, they are taught English

208
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,700
fast and then the mother tongue or

209
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,900
not at all a good

210
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,700
thing for me even now

211
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,900
we are speaking about English Vinay

212
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,400
discussing any other language

213
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,800
that

214
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,500
itself

215
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,600
shows how we give

216
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,700
English more important than any other

217
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,000
disappear

218
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,900
the regional languages. What would that mean for the

219
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,400
next generation of Indians Goa

220
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,700
It would be

221
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,500
really bad. I think people

222
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,900
from other countries come to India

223
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,400
to see the culture and

224
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,700
everything and we might just lose it

225
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,300
on the way. I

226
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,400
just hope we don't really

227
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,300
think it would

228
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,600
go anywhere

229
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,700
continue speaking Hindi

230
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,800
Marathi anything learn to speak

231
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,900
language language is important. But

232
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,600
do not forget you come from society

233
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,900
group of people of

234
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,700
different committee. Do not forget that

235
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,600
do not forget your roots

236
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,600
English

237
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,600
